Instructions to execute:
1. make (to compile and link)
2. make test (runs all the 10 test cases given in the assignment)
____________________________________________
The Input Files are inside the InputFiles folder:
to run a particular case: copy the file from the InputFiles to A6_31_test1.c file
the executable will be ./test1 (for future use!)
____________________________________________
Shortcomings and limitations:
1. We have confined ourselves to the limitations in accordance to the assignment.
2. Function prototyping has not been dealt with separately, so the code expects only function declration has to be present in the code.
